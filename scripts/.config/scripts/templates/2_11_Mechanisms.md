# Classifying reactions
- **addition** - when two or more subtances combine to form one product
  - eg \ce{C2H4 + Br2 -> C2H4Br2}
- **elimination** - when one reactant reacts to produce a new substance and a small molecule (eg \ce{H2O, H2})
  - \ce{CH3CH2CH2Br + KOH(alc) -> CH3CH=CH2 + KBr + H2O}
- **substitution** - when a group of atoms is replaced by another atom
  - \ce{CH3CH2CH2Cl + KOH(aq) -> CH3CH2CH2OH + KCl}
- **oxidation** - addition of oxygen during a chemical reaction
  - \ce{CH3CH2OH + [O] -> CH3COOH + H2O}
- **reduction** - removal of oxygen/addition of hydrogen atoms to a molecule
  - \ce{CH3COCH3 + [H] ->[LiAlH4 or NaBH4] -> CH3CH(OH)CH3}
- **hydrolysis** - when a molecule is broken down by the addition of water
  - \ce{CH3CHClCH3 + KOH -> CH3CH(OH)CH3 + Cl-(aq)}
- **polymerisation** - when many small identical molecules join to fomr a large molecule
  - \ce{n(CH2=CH2) -> -(CH2-CH2)-n}

# Types of mechanisms
- **homolytic fission**
  - when a bond breaks and one of the atom keeps one of the shared electron pair
  - \ce{Cl-Cl ->[uv] Cl. + .Cl}
- **heterolytic fission**
  - when a bond breaks and both of the electrons are kept by one atom
  - froms a cation and an anion
  - \ce{H-Cl -> H+ + Cl-}

## Definitions
- **free radical** - atom/molecule that has a single unpaired electron in its outer shell
- **electrophile** - electron deficient, targets lone pairs
- **nucleophile** - electron-rich centered, donates a pair of e- to form a new covalent bond

# Ozone depletion
- ozone protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation (prevents skin cancer)
- with CFCs
  - \ce{CCl2F2 -> .CClF2 + Cl.}
  - \ce{Cl. + O3 -> .ClO + O2}
  - \ce{.ClO + O3 -> 2O2 + .Cl}
- with \ce{NOx}
  - \ce{NO. + O3 -> NO2 + O2}
  - \ce{NO2. + O3 -> NO. + O2}
  - overall: \ce{2O3 -> 3O2}
